  itemDescription: Crafted from the iridescent scales of mighty wyverns, this sword
    exudes a sinister elegance. Its blade, forged with precision, gleams with a hypnotic
    sheen, reflecting hues of emerald and obsidian. Each swing releases a faint scent
    of charred wood, reminiscent of the fiery breath these creatures unleash. As
    it cuts through the air, a subtle whisper echoes, carrying the ancient tales
    of the wyvern's prowess and the valor of those who wield its scaled essence.
